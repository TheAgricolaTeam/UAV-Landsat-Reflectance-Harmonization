# UAV-Landsat-Reflectance-Harmonization
This is a piece of code, developed in Matlab, to improve spectral/reflectance response between custom uav sensors and Landsat 8 surface reflectance using NASA Point Spread Function for each Landsat satellite band. This code is useful when the UAV camera is a modified RGB, NIR, rather than a narrowband sensor.
